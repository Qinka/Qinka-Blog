# Six Items to Avoid Bad Performance

1. Understanding lazy evaluation schemas and their implications

2. Handing intended and unintended value memoization (CAFs)

3. Utilizing(guarded) recursion and the worker/wrapper parttern efficiently

4. Using accumulators correctlu to avoid space leaks

5. Analyzing strictness and space usage of Haskell programs

6. Important compiler code optimizations, inlining and fusion
