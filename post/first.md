First Post of New Site
==

This is the first post for the new long term supported site. my blog. And I write this post in English, for no reasons.
The resaon I write this post is just for I think this site is just a check point, and I want to write down my personal
summary. Of course, I will write down my plan of my futher.

# New Glob
My old site used Glob 0.0.8.x, and that one is not bad, but  not good enough. The new one is using Glob 0.0.10.x.
I rewrote some parts of Glob, thought it's still a no good application.

The "blog" and the "page" are rewrote to "post". In database, I turn to MongoDB, where I used PostgreSQL. 
And the way, uploading by using GNU-make, is the worst one which is unfriendly for those user, including me.
But fortunately, there are the way that writing a page to upload is feasible.

I build Glob's docker image with Travis-CI and llvm. Travis-CI is a good tool in development, and I think llvm and ghc's thread extension 
can make glob run faster with such small docker container.

# New Frontend
I not good at frontend, so my blog's frontend is being more ugly if more I write. Oh, I am not good at English, so if there some things wrong,
take it easy.

# Webcast
I will webcast coding on [Huya](www.huya.com).
