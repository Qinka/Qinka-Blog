# Code hosted

For a open-source software, it should be hosted at a **open** and **free** site.
So the first thing is where should we host codes.
The second thing is what kind of documents a project should have.
Thirdly, I will talk about the free services we should use for a open source project.
Then I will talk about the maintaining. The final part is about another things.

## Hosting codes

I think the first hosting server provider I want to talk about is GitHub.
GitHub is the more famous one in the World.
The tops in IT area, such Google and Microsoft, create the organizations and build
the open source softwares on GitHub. So I think everyone understand why GitHub is best.

And I also think the BitBucket, GitLab, and LaunchPad.net are good service providers.
