\section{Weekly Briefing of Papers - (Apr. 15, 2018)}

\subsection{[arXiv:1804.03492]PointNetVLAD: Deep Point Cloud Based Retrieval for
  Large-Scale Place Recognition}

This paper is about PointNet, NetVLAD and large-scale place. The idea of this
paper is to combine PointNet and NetVLAD.
The details of this paper are availiable by following the
\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03492}{link}.

\subsection{[arXiv:1804.03550]Two Stream 3D Semantic Scene Completion}

This paper uses two stream in their network. The key idea is to use one stream
for processing depth information, and to use other stream to process RGB color.
The details of this paper can be found by following the
\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03550}{link}.

\subsection{[arXiv:1804.03583]Classification of Point Cloud Scenes with
  Multiscale Voxel Deep Network}

It is another paper using voxel with points cloud for 3D deep learning.
The different between this one with others is ``multiscale''.
They use three kinds of data with different resolutions in their network.
The details can be found by following the \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03583}{link}.

\subsection{[arXiv:1804.01654]Pixel2Mesh: Generating 3D Mesh Models from Single
  RGB Images}

This paper is about generating 3D mesh with 2D images.
The details can be found by following the
\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01654}{link}.

\subsection{[arXiv:1804.01117]Visual Object Categorization Based on Hierarchical
  Shape Motifs Learned From Noisy Point Cloud Decompositions}

This paper is about using noisy point cloud for ``classification''.
The different between real classification is it should be called as
segmentation. The results of network can tell the differents between each thing.
It can label an object with a label and possibility, such as ``can(80\%)''.
This paper includes 3D deep learning on points cloud, and graph.
The details are availiable by following the \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01117}{link}.

\subsection{[1804.00782]3D Interpreter Networks for Viewer-Centered Wireframe
  Modeling}

This paper is about using 2D image to get the 3D key points of a object.
The details can be found by following the
\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00782}{link}.

\subsection{[1804.04610]Pix3D: Dataset and Methods for Single-Image 3D Shape
  Modeling}

Another paper using 2D image to generate 3D models.
There are details in the following
\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04610}{link}.
