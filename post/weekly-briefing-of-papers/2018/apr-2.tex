\section{Weekly Briefing of Papers - (Apr. 13, 2018)}

\subsection{[arXiv:1804.03492]PointNetVLAD: Deep Point Cloud Based Retrieval for
  Large-Scale Place Recognition}

This paper is about PointNet, NetVLAD and large-scale place. The idea of this
paper is to combine PointNet and NetVLAD.
The details of this paper are availiable by following the
\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03492}{link}.

\subsection{[arXiv:1804.03550]Two Stream 3D Semantic Scene Completion}

This paper uses two stream in their network. The key idea is to use one stream
for processing depth information, and to use other stream to process RGB color.
The details of this paper can be found by following the
\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03550}{link}.

\subsection{[arXiv:1804.03583]Classification of Point Cloud Scenes with
  Multiscale Voxel Deep Network}

It is another paper using voxel with points cloud for 3D deep learning.
The different between this one with others is ``multiscale''.
They use three kinds of data with different resolutions in their network.
The details can be found by following the \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03583}{link}.
