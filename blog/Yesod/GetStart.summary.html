  This post, we should call this note, is about building web application wtih Yesod and Haskell. 
  This series of post is all about that. For the first part, this post, I will write down the some basic usage of Yesod
  or we can just call it the note not post, of how to build a HelloWorld site, of the hamlet, lucius,
   cassius, and julius' usage. This post is just a introduction to Yesod. And I will add some
   "copy" from the book DEVELOPING WEB APPLICATION WITH HASKELL AND YESOD (SECOND EDITION), and
   the wiki, on the GitHub to this post. And at the end of this post, I will list a series document
   about learning Yesod and getting-start with Yesod.
