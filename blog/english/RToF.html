  <h1> The Reaction of THE TAIL OF FAME</h1>
  <p>
    Before I read the article "The Tail of Fame", I had heard a sentence,
    "Haskell has a sort of unoffical slogan: avoid success at all cost",
    which was said by Simon P. Jones, Microsoft Research.
    <sup><a href="#ref-taofplh">[1]</a></sup>
    Haskell is a very good programming-language, named with a greate computer
    scientist Haskell Curry, with the best Data-Type System in the world.
    Why Jones, the main contributor of Haskell, says that?
    After read "The Tail of Fame", I got the answer.
  </p>
  <p>
    People mostly think that a person who tries his or her best to avoid success,
    fame, and money is abnormal. But chasing fame, success, and money
    is just like a dog chasing it's tail.
    There is an old saying in China, and it's meaning is that the more you had said,
    the more error you will make.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just like what the article has described, chasing success, fame, and money
    means that we need to give up something. People always have something,
    which they hate, and another thing which they like.
    When having to choose between the things we like and the success, fame, and money,
    different people have different chooses.
    Those who are trying to avoid success, fame, and money choose what they like, and
    they, I think, are right.
  </p>
  <p>
    The contributors of Haskell choose a way -- avoid success at all costs,
    because they think the cost of success will make Haskell lose what
    a good language should have. They might want Haskell to become an artwork.
