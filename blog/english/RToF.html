  <h1> The Reaction of THE TAIL OF FAME</h1>
  <p>
    The most people think that whatever they do, did, or done, their are aiming at fame, money, and so on.
    And that is the most normal thing in the "world". But there are some people in this world,
    who are trying their best to avoid success. ANd until now, I know the reason -- the tail of fame.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is an old saying in China, and it's meaning is that the more you said, the more possibly there
    are the errors in what you had said. It might be same with fame and money.
    The one of the greatest contributor of Haskell, Simon P. Jones, Microsoft Research,
    had said "Haskell has a sort of unoffical slogan: avoid successat all cost"
    <cite><a href="http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/261007/a-z_programming_languages_haskell/?pp=10">
      The A-Z of Programming Languages: Haskell</a></cite> .
    The tail of fame, the tail of money, and the tail of success are just like the tail of a dog.
    Those, who catching these tails, is just same with dog.
    What can they do when they had catched it? Nothing, but catching continually.
