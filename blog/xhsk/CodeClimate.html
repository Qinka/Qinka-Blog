  <h1>Code Climate</h1>

  <p>
    Today we will talk about a tool named Code Climate. 
    Somebody might ask what Code Climate is, and my answer is "a suite of static analysis".
  </p>

  <p>
    The first time when came across Code Climate is after I clicked <em>Integrations</em> on the GitHub.
    I try searching that on the Internet,and finally find an answer: 
    After using Code Climate, you will refactor your code every second. That is half a joke.
    However such a tool will help you to improve code quality.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course, Code Climate is open source now. Meanwhile you can link your GitHub account to Code Climate, and analysis your project.
    To analysis project, you need to write a YAML file named .codeclimate.yml and configure analysis system with this file. 
    The detail can be found in Code Climate&#39;s official website.
  </p>

  <p>And those are what I want to talk with you. And have a nice day.</p>
