  <h1>Haskell</h1>
  <p>
     Haskell is an advanced purely-functional programming language. 
     It began life in the late 1980s as an intened standard language for lazy functional programming. 
     Since it was created, Haskell has gone thorugh various changes, and the current standard of Haskell is Haskell 2010.
     Haskell was Haskell Curry's first name, and because he, 
     Haskell Curry had already given his name to a process called 'currying' and Haskell is called Haskell.<sup><cite>[1]</cite></sup>

  <h2>Haskell is statically typed</h2>
  <p>
    Each expression in Haskell will be tagged with a type which is determined at compile time.
    And the compiler will check the type, and if the types composed together by function application do not match up, 
    the codes will be rejected by compiler.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Haskell has type inference</h2>
  <p>
    The types of the functions and expressions will be inferred by unifying every type bidirectionally.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Haskell is lazy</h2>
  <p>
    We called it lazy that: When it needed, it is needed. Another meaning is "called by need".
  </p>
  
  <h2>Haskell is purely functional</h2>
  <p>
    Each function in Haskell is a function in the mathematical sence. 
    Haskell split the side-effection IO and pure function with IO Monad, so you can prove these pure functions with math.
  </p>

  <h2>Haskell is concurrent</h2>
  <p>
    Haskell is concurrent. You can write an asynchronous function easily with Haskell. And Haskell has atomic threading.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Haskell has Hackage and Stackage</h2>
  <p>
    Hackage(with cabal) and stackage(with stack) are the most famous package servers of Hackage. They are useful and open source.
