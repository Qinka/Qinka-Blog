repos if you think those are useful.

## SKILL

The main research direction I working on is **3D computer vision** with **deep learning**. I am also working on **embedded system development**.

I can do the following things more or less:

* C/C++ development (especially embedded system, e.g. STM32, RaspberryPi)
* C# development (I'm a registered developer on MS-Windows UWP)
* Haskell (with functional program skills)
* Python (familiar with Tensorflow and PyTorch)
* LaTeX
* Verilog HDL (FPGA)
* Circuit schematic & PCB 
* CUDA & OpenCL
* OpenGL
* Html/CSS/Javascript
* 3D Computer Vision and Deep Learning

## Gaming

* World of Tanks
* World of Warships
* Besiege

## About this testing site

This site is a testing site. The things will not always go well,
while the newest blog will be pushed to here first.

So if you find any bug of blog's frontend and back-end,
you can raise an issues at [GitHub:Qinka/Qinka-Blog/issues](https://github.com/Qinka/Qinka-Blog/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue).
